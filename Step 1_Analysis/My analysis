This problem requires a low cost pet-feeder with a few different features:
-	A system that can remember time
-	A system that can schedule feeding times
-	A dispenser for the food
-	A sensor to recognise if there is still food after being dispensed
-	A sensor that counts the amount of food that has been dispensed and compares it to the amount being eaten
-	An alarm system

We assume that:
-	Feeding times have been assigned
-	Food is being weighed
-	Thereâ€™s a database

Limits may be:
-	The amount of memory the system has.
-	Animals may accidently tamper with the sensors or scale leading to false alarm activation and weights being recorded.
